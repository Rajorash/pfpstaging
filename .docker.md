6. Restart you Computer

7. Run powerShell command with Administrative privileges:

```powershell

```

## Install ubuntu for WSL2

8. Open Microsoft Store https://aka.ms/wslstore and select Ubuntu 20.04 (or newer), install it

9. Run Ubuntu

10. Enter User's name and password, like `ubuntu`

## Install and configure Docker for Windows

11. Download and install **Docker Desktop** https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/#download

    restart

15. Go to **Settings > Resources > WSL Integration** and select from your installed WSL 2 distributions which you want
    to **enable Docker integration** + **Enable integration with additional distro** (Ubuntu)

16. To confirm that Docker has been installed, open a WSL distribution (e.g. Ubuntu) and display the version and build
    number by entering:

```bash    
$ docker --version
```

17. Answer must be like this:

```bash    
$ Docker version 20.10.7, build f0df350
```

18. Test that your installation works correctly by running a simple built-in Docker image using:

```bash    
$ docker run hello-world or sudo docker run hello-world
```    

## Laravel Sail

18. Install Laravel Sail into current project

```bash
$ composer require laravel/sail --dev
```

19. If file **docker-compose.yml** not found in project folder:

    19.1 create it via command:
    ```bash
    php artisan sail:install
    ```

    19.2 make copy from file **.docker-compose.yml.example**

20. Install Windows Terminal https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/terminal/get-started

21. Open Windows Terminal and run **Ubuntu** (symbol "chevron down" near last tab)

22. **!!! All next commands only from Ubuntu:**

23. Go to you project folder

24. Create alias for sail command

```bash 
$ alias sail='bash ./vendor/bin/sail'
```

25. Type:

```bash
$ sail up
```
or to run docker in background mode

```bash
$ sail up -d
```

26. Enjoy!

## Tips and tricks

1. If You use a project mounted from the Windows folder - the speed will be slow. For increase speed move project (or clone it) into **/home/user/project-name/** folder, and run docker from here

2. Command ```$ sail share``` decrease the speed of project. 

## Other Sail commands

1. Commands:
    - Running Artisan commands locally...
    - ```$ php artisan queue:work ```
    - Running Artisan commands within Laravel Sail...
    - ```$ sail artisan queue:work```

2. After change configuration of docker file:
    - ```$ sail build --no-cache```
    - ```$ sail up```

3. Clear configs:
    - ```$ sail artisan config:cache && sail artisan cache:clear && sail artisan view:clear && sail artisan config:cache && sail artisan event:clear```

4. Share domain with local domain (when using ```$ sail share```)
    - edit file: **app/Http/Middleware/TrustProxies.php**. Change to: **protected $proxies = '\*';**
    - ```$ sail share --subdomain=my-sail-site```
    - Example: ```$ sail share --subdomain=pfp```

5. Remove containers (delete all saved data, database, etc)
    - ```$ sail down -v``` (only when sail is down)

## Known issues

1. App cannot connect to Database
    - check if in file .env is **DB_HOST=mysql**
